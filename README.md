[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snieking/chromunity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snieking/chromunity) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/snieking/chromunity/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/snieking/chromunity?branch=dev)

Chromunity is a decentralized social media site where the data is stored in a blockchain. It is built with Rell, an easy to learn and powerful language. Rell is used to interact with https://chromia.com

## Copyrighted font
Chromunity uses a copyrighted font which is not included in the repository.

In order to use the Chromia font, add **Battlefin-Black.otf** to **public/fonts** directory in order to use that font. 
The application will work fine without it and fall back to other fonts.
